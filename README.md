# XtremeDefender
Nowadays nearly all urban household have a security system (camera) installed in their house and the need for a much efficient Home Security System is the need of the Indian Security Marketplace.

In India everyday many theft and robberies occurs in Houses of people. Due to which many people have to suffer huge losses. On the other hand the security system should be affordable & robust and should consume less energy with proper running.

So Xtreme Defender 666 is a fully automated home security system made using Arduino Platform serving the needs of Security Industry.

# Speciality
Detect illegal trespassing Installs in any Household Motion Sensing Technology Lock home with single click Save your home from theft Show Date and Time

There are various sensors installed in the Security system which with gather responses from the environment and the responses will be processed in the Arduino to generate output.

This Security System gives the power to user to lock their home with just a single press of a button and track if some illegal trespassing happens in an active environment. This can be installed in any House easily and has very less or no maintenance cost.

# Advantages
1. Works in an Active environment (notify in Real Time)
2. Cost of security system is low as compared to other solutions in the market.
3. Promotion of Made in India 4. Notification LED’s
5. Systemwillnotbeactivatedif
doors are not locked.
6. LCDdisplaytointeractwithuser

# Requirements

## Arduino (mega)
Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.

## Hardware Requirements
1. HD44780 (LCD)
2. DS1307 (RTC Module)
3. HC-SR501 (PIR Sensor)
4. 4 X 4 Matrix array Switch
5. Servo Motor
6. Buzzer
7. Relay Module
8. Breadboard, Wires and LED's

## Software Requirements
The software of this project will be written on the Arduino IDE which is an open source Software based on Processing.
The IDE is used to write code and upload it to the Arduino board. The Language used to write program is Arduino Programming Language which is based on Wiring.

# Future Scope
1. Connect it with GSM Module (receive SMS on mobile when activity occur)
2. Add finger print scanner and other Sensors
3. Add Camera Module and stream video over RTSP
4. Make a server for sending the data to internet.
